# Project Name
> House Price Prediction using Advanced Regression

**Background**: A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia. The data is provided in the CSV file below.

**Analytical Goal**:
1. A regression model using regularization in order to perdict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.
2. which variables are significant in predicting the prices of a house
3. How well those variables describe the price of a house
